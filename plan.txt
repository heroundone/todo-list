PAGE LAYOUT
- app title
- sidebar for selecting projects  - content of selected projects

PROJECT LAYOUT (project is an object and to-do's are objects also)
- has title and deadline
- open it to see what to-do's need to be done, description, their due dates(optional), optional priority(if no input, 
default is 0), HAVE TO-DO'S ADDED IN AN UNORDERED LIST WHEN PROJECT OPENED

LOGIC
- upon loading show general project(contains miscellaneous to-do's)
- one tab on sidebar for projects with deadline of today(need function to get today's date)
- one tab for display all projects(when project is clicked on, show to-do's contained within)
- one tab on sidebar for sorting projects by priority(higher number at top)
- one tab for sorting by deadline

- can delete individual to-do's and projects(icon to click on, alerts user, asks for permission with prompt)


upon loading check local storage,
if it has contents
look for general project,
    load it and display, load other projects
no general project, load other projects, display empty general project

add new project(button)
prompt for title and deadline
display new project to input to-do's

add to-do
prompt for description, deadline, and priority

!!!// HAVE main.js handle the DOM injections, and the other modules will handle data manipulation, main.js
will handle the displaying of the data the other modules get and retrieve the data
